			<p class="description">Smaug, considered the last “great” dragon to exist in Middle-earth, is a fire drake (another term for fire-breathing dragon.) Smaug was attracted to the wealth gathered by the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain during King Thror’s reign, hoarding the treasures to himself for nearly 200 hundred years.</p>
